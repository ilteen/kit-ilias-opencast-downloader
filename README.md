This is a fork of https://github.com/SeineEloquenz/kit-ilias-opencast-downloader to port it to Safari for iPadOS/iOS/macOS 
Much of the original code and icon was adopted, changes were only made where needed.

This safari extension adds a download button to your safari bar (and context manu on macOS) on lecture recordings in the KIT ilias system.
The extension downloads them by finding the link to the video file in the page source.
No security measures or whatsoever of Ilias are bypassed.
You could do this by hand, but that's tedious.
